Our system consists of 3 parts:

Front-end (node):
To deploy the front-end, go to the "front" folder and run "npm install".
You can run the system by executing "npm start".

Back-end:
Our back-end consists of a server that receives pdf files as requests to extract
contract info
Dependencies:

Blockchain:
The blockchain smart contracts are deployed on the Rinkeby testnet. The contracts
are already deployed and ready to be used by the web system. If you wish to deploy
your own instances, change the deployAddress in utils/deploy.js and run
"node utils/deploy.js"
